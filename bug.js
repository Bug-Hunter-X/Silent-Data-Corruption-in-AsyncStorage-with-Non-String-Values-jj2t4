In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using AsyncStorage to store complex data structures like objects or arrays.  The AsyncStorage API only accepts strings.  Attempting to store a non-string value directly will result in a silent failure, or unexpected behavior further down the line.  The app may not crash, but the stored data will be corrupted or lost. For example:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const myObject = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 };

AsyncStorage.setItem('myKey', myObject) //This will cause the issue
.then(() => {
  console.log('Object stored successfully!'); //This will log successfully even if data is lost
})
.catch(error => {
  console.log('Error storing object:', error); //This might not catch the error because the issue is silent
});
```
